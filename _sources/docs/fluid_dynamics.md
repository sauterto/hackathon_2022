### Exercises:

>**Task 1**: Hurricane-force winds of 60 m s$^{–1}$ blow into an west-facing
>entrance of a 20 m long pedestrian tunnel. The door at the other end of the
>tunnel is closed. The initial air density in the tunnel is 1.2 kg m$^{–3}$. Find
>the rate of air density increase in the tunnel.

>**Task 2**: In a narrow street canyon, a fine particle matter load of 30 
>$\mu g \cdot  m^{−3}$ is measured. A moderate wind blows from the south, advecting further
>particles from a busy road. The concentration at the road is 130 $\mu g \cdot m^{-3}$.
>Turbulent mixing causes 194 $\mu g \cdot m \cdot s^{-1}$ to be entrained upwards. Does the
>concentration exceed the critical threshold value of 150 $\mu g \cdot m^{-3}$ after one
>hour?

>**Task 3**: The cube of air below has $\theta$ = 12°C along its south side, but
>smoothly increases in temperature to 15°C on the north side. This 100 km
>square cube is advecting toward the north at 25 km/hour. What warming rate at
>a fixed thermometer can be attributed to temperature advection?

>**Task 4**:In the figure above (Task 3), suppose that the incoming heat flux from the
>south is 5 W m$^{–2}$, and the outgoing on the north face of the cube is 7 W m$^{–2}$. 
>
> 1. Convert these fluxes to kinematic units.  
> 2. What is the value of the kinematic flux gradient?  
> 3. Calculate the warming rate of air in the cube, assuming the cube has zero
> humidity and is at a fixed altitude where air density is 1 kg m$^{–3}$. The
> cube of air is 10 m on each side.

>**Task 5**: Bremen is about 600 km north of Stuttgart. In Bremen the wind
>components (U, V) are (6, 4) m s$^{–1}$ , while in Stuttgart they are (2, 10) m
>s$^{–1}$. What is the value of the advective force per mass?

### Homework:

>**Homework 1**: Given the figure below, assume that higher in the
>figure corresponds to higher in the atmosphere. Suppose that the 5°C air is at
>a relative altitude that is 500 m higher than that of the 10°C air. If the
>updraft is 500 m/(10 hours), what is the temperature at the thermometer
>(yellow circle) after 10 hours?

>**Homework 2**: The potential temperature of the air increases 5°C per 100 km
>distance east. If an east wind of 20 m s$^{–1}$ is blowing, find the advective flux
>gradient, and the temperature change associated with this advection.

>**Homework 3**: Suppose that the turbulent heat flux decreases linearly with
>height according to $\overline{w'\theta'}=a-b \cdot z$, where a = 0.3 (K ms$^{-1}$) and b = $3 \cdot 10^{−4}$
>(K s$^{-1}$). If the initial temperature profile is an arbitrary shape, then what
>will be the shape of the final profile on hour later? Neglecting subsidence,
>radiation, latent heating, and assume horizontal heterogeneity.

>**Homework 4**: If a horizontal wind of 10 m/s is advecting drier
>air into a region, where the horizontal moisture gradient is (5
>g$_{water}$/kg$_{air}$)/100 km, then what vertical gradient of turbulent moisture flux
>in the boundary layer is required to maintain a steady-state specific
>humidity? Assume there is no body source of moisture.

>**Homework 5**: : Find the rate of temperature change (°C h$^{–1}$) with no
>internal heat source, given the kinematic flux divergence values below. Assume
>$\Delta x = \Delta y = \Delta z = 1$ km.
