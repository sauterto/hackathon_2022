# Lesson 0 -Introduction to Python

The following lesson and exercises are not intended to replace an introduction
to Python and Jupyter Notebook. Rather, the exercises are intended to refresh
and recall existing knowledge. The notebooks are not about working out
solutions independently, but are intended as a kind of cheatsheet. There are
different sections that repeat different Python elements that are relevant for
the further units. Those with experience in Python can safely skip the lessons.
