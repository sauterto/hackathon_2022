# Welcome to the Hackathon 

In this event, we will focus on a clearly defined scientific topic for the next
two days and try to write a short manuscript. A hackathon is an event where
interdisciplinary scientists from different fields of research try to find
innovative solutions for specific problems that are difficult to solve without
the diverse expertise. Here we want to take up a research question that can be
answered without time-consuming numerical simulations and can be efficiently
solved in teamwork.
