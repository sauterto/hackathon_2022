# Research Question
The summer of 2021/22 was one of the driest in southern South America, if not
the driest, since the beginning of meteorological observations.  This drought
could be observed very well this year in the glacier changes and the drought
stress of the vegetation.  So far, there has been neither an in-depth
processing of the observations of this extreme event nor an analysis of the
underlying causes. Here we want to

1) **closely examine the various in-situ, remote sensing and reanalysis data to
understand the magnitude of this extreme event** and 

2) **isolate the amtospheric drivers** that led to this event.

Satellite gravimetry data indicates the ongoing drought is the continent's
second most intense since 2002.  (Landsat 8 Image of the Day for November 4, 2020)
