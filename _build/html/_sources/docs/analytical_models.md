# Lesson 1 - Global Energy Balance Model
In this lesson we look at a simple conceptual global energy balance model. We
first get an overview of the energy fluxes in the atmosphere and then gradually build up the
model. We will use this model to get a basic understanding of the
processes taking place in the atmosphere. Even if the model only represents reality in a very
simplified way, it can help us to better understand the interaction of the
simultaneously occurring complex processes.
