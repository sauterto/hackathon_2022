### Energy balance of the one-layer model

#### Assumptions
Shortwave radiation:
- Atmosphere is completely transparent to shortwave solar radiation
- The surface absorbs shortwave radiation

Longwave radiation 
- Both surface and atmosphere emit radiation as blackbodies
- Atmosphere is a single layer of air
- Atmosphere is completely opaque to infrared radiation
- Atmosphere radiates equally up and down
- There are no other heat transfer mechanisms

As with the simple energy balance model, we draw up the energy balances. This
time we look at the energy balance of each layer individually and solve the two
equations according to the equilibrium surface temperature.

The earth's surface gains energy from the absorbed short-wave radiation and the
long-wave radiation from the atmosphere. Only the outgoing long-wave radiation causes
the Earth's surface to lose energy. Thus, the energy balance equation can be
written as follows:

$$
(1-\alpha) \cdot Q + \sigma T_a^4 = \sigma T_s^4.
$$ (EB_surface)

The atmosphere, on the other hand, receives additional energy through the
long-wave radiation of the Earth's surface and loses energy in the form of
long-wave radiation in the direction of the Earth's surface and outer space.
The budget can thus be written as

$$
\sigma T_s^4 = 2 \sigma T_a^4.
$$ (EB_atm)

 The factor 2 (on the right hand side) results from the fact that the atmosphere emits both towards the
Earth's surface and into space. Therefore, the surface temperature must have
$T_s>T_a$ with $T_s = \sqrt[\leftroot{-2}\uproot{2}4]{2} \cdot T_a \approx 1.2
\cdot T_a$. 

> **Task 1**: Plug Eq. {eq}`EB_atm` into Eq. {eq}`EB_surface` and solve for
> the radiative equilibrium suface temperature $T_e$. Since all
> the outgoing longwave radiation to outer space results from the atmosphere,
> the atmospheric temperture $T_a$ is identical to the emission temperature $T_e$.

> **Task 2**: Where in the atmosphere do we find the calculated $T_e$? (Live-coding, {download}`Download netCDF-file<./files/air.mon.ltm.1981-2010.nc>`)

> **Task 3**: What is the surface temperature with the single layer model? Why
> does the model overestimate the surface temperature?



### Energy balance of the two-layer model
In this part we want to introduce a more sophisticated two-layer model for the
long-wave radiative transfer. In addition to an additional layer, we also
assume that each layer absorbs only a part of the radiation. This conceptual
model shows nicely how the greenhouse effect works.

#### Assumptions
- The atmosphere is transparent to shortwave radiation
- Divide the atmosphere up into two layers of equal mass (the dividing line is thus at 500 hPa pressure level)
- Each layer absorbs only a fraction $\epsilon$ of whatever longwave radiation is incident upon it
- Assume $\epsilon$ is the same in each layer

This modelling approach is called the **grey gas model**. The designation grey is
intended to indicate that there is no spectral dependence of absorption and
emission.

In the following, we consider the upward beam of long-wave radiation, which is
labelled U in fig. The earth's surface emits long-wave energy according to
the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

$$
U_0 = (\sigma T_s^4)
$$ (Ts)

A fraction of this radiation is absorbed by layer 0. The remaining portion is
passed on to layer 1 with the additional radiation coming from layer 0. The flux
between layer 0 and layer 1 can then be written as

$$
U_1=(1-\epsilon)\sigma T_s^4+\epsilon \sigma T_0^4
$$ (U1)

Similarly, the upward longwave radiation above layer 1 can be determined and written as 

$$
U_2=(1-\epsilon)U_1+\epsilon \sigma T_1^4
$$ (U2)

> **Task 4**: Since there is no more atmosphere above layer 1, this upwelling
> beam is our OLR for this model. Plug $U_1$ into the equation of $U_2$ and
> solve the equation. What do the terms represent? 

> **Task 5**: Write a Python function for the `OLR` (Task 3). 

> **Task 6**: What happens if $\epsilon$ is zero or one? What does this mean physically?

> **Task 7**: We will tune our model so that it reproduces the observed global mean OLR given observed global mean temperatures. Determine the average temperatures (1000-500 hPa, 500 hPa to tropopause) for the two-layer model from the following sounding.
